# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring an existing monolithic React portfolio component into a well-structured Next.js application with reusable components, proper file organization, and modern development practices. The goal is to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality and visual design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the portfolio application to be structured as a proper Next.js project, so that I can benefit from Next.js features like file-based routing, optimized builds, and better SEO.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the application SHALL be a valid Next.js project with proper directory structure
2. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use Next.js optimization features like automatic code splitting and image optimization
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality and visual appearance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the large monolithic component to be broken down into smaller, reusable components, so that the code is more maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are extracted THEN each component SHALL have a single responsibility
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN components are reused THEN they SHALL accept props for customization
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN no component SHALL exceed 200 lines of code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper file organization and component structure, so that I can easily locate and modify specific parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is organized THEN components SHALL be grouped in logical directories (ui, sections, layout)
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN utilities are extracted THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate utility directories
4. WHEN types are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized in a types directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use modern Next.js patterns and best practices, so that it follows current industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL use the Next.js App Router (app directory)
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL properly separate client and server components
3. WHEN styling is implemented THEN it SHALL use Tailwind CSS with proper configuration
4. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL implement proper loading states and error boundaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored application to maintain all existing animations and interactions, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations are implemented THEN they SHALL use Framer Motion as in the original
2. WHEN interactions are preserved THEN scroll-based animations SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN the theme toggle is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same functionality
4. WHEN the mobile menu is opened THEN it SHALL animate properly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper data management and content structure, so that portfolio content can be easily updated and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is structured THEN portfolio content SHALL be extracted to separate data files
2. WHEN content is updated THEN it SHALL not require code changes
3. WHEN new projects are added THEN they SHALL follow a consistent data schema
4. WHEN the application renders THEN it SHALL handle missing or invalid data gracefully
