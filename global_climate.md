# Climate Visualization Platform: A Global Time-Lapse Journey Through Climate Change

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from witnessing the stark reality of climate change affecting communities worldwide. While climate data exists in abundance, it remains largely inaccessible to the general public - trapped in scientific papers and complex datasets. We realized that  **data alone isn't enough**. People need to  _see_  and  _feel_  the impact of climate change to truly understand its urgency, regardless of where they live.

We were inspired by the power of visual storytelling and the global reach of Google's Earth Engine platform. The idea was simple yet profound:  **What if we could show 40+ years of climate data for any location on Earth as a compelling visual narrative that anyone could understand?**

## What it does
